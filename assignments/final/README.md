# Design Document

## Gameplay description:
The camera will follow a character that the user controls as they travel on the surface of a planet. They will collect different items to rebuild their spaceship and also collect oxygen tanks to keep their oxygen level from depleting too much. The game is won when the user is able to collect all the pieces to the spaceship to rebuild it, and the game is lost if they run out of oxygen. The world will be contained by cliffs around the edges of the playable space that the character is not able to jump over. 

## Input:
The input from the user will be in the form of controls. They will be able to use W, A, S, and D or the arrow keys to control the main character of the game as they travel across the planet. 

## Visual Style:
The game will be in a 3-D style with lots of color and cute, non super realistic characters and objects. The colors will be mostly blues, pinks, and purples and there will be some particles showing where the different objects are that the user must collect as well as the oxygen tanks that they can pick up. I would like it to have the feel of and indie style game, so a bit cozy and cute with bright, warm, colors, rather than dark and harsh tones. Below are some inspiration pictures that may be a bit advanced for the final, but show the sort of style that I am taking notes from.

## Audio Style:
There will be a little song playing throughout. There will be sound effects when a character collects oxygen, when they collect a piece to the spaceship, and when they complete the game. If time allows, there will also be sound effects to indicate when oxygen is getting low. 

## Interface sketches:
Below are some sketches to give a general idea of what the interface of the game will look like including the different starting, winning, and losing screens. The Figma file that I used to create them is also linked below:

## Story/theme description:
The premise of the game is that the character’s spaceship crash landed on a planet and some of the pieces flew away from the ship. The player must go around the planet to try and collect the missing parts to their spaceship in order to rebuild it. Their oxygen tanks were also scattered around the planet, and they must also collect those as they go if they are not able to collect all the pieces quickly enough so that they do not run out of oxygen. After they collect all of the pieces to the spaceship, they will be able to fix it and return home. 

## Three feature set targets:
### The “Low-bar” of what you will create (this should still be a “complete game”):
The low bar of the game will be to have the character just have to collect the parts to the spaceship in order to rebuild it. There will not be any sort of oxygen system, but the character will have the same movement features and controls in order to pick up the pieces to the broken spaceship. 

### A target that you expect to get done:
The target of what I expect to get done is to create the game as it was described above. The character will move around and collect the broken pieces to the spaceship in order to put it back together and return home, but there will also be a system where the oxygen level of the character will deplete and they need to collect oxygen packs in order to continue on without losing. 

### A desired high-bar if things go exceptionally well:
The high bar will have all the characteristics as the target level, but will also have a level with enemies. If the player gets too close to the enemies, they will come alive and follow the player, doing damage to them that will be shown on another health bar. This health bar getting low will be another way that the player could lose the game. 

## A timeline of what you need to accomplish and by when to complete your game on time:

### Friday, December 1st: 
Design Document completed, begin working on unity project. 

### Tuesday, December 5th: 
Get the game working with the character able to move around and the scene designed, begin to work on scripts to get the character to collect the pieces to the spaceship.

### Friday, December 8th: 
Finish the aspect of the game that allows the player to pick up the pieces of the spaceship, begin to implement the oxygen tank system. 

### Final Due Date, December 15th: 
Project completed.
